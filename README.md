Hi Reader,

I am very excited while creating this simple Counter app in React.


Yesssss, I am a backend developer and looking for to expand my horizon!
This is my first application built using React and would love to hear from you about any feedback.

I have not just created simple Counter app but also played little more with new Component, JSX & CSS to make it more appealing.

Following are the screenshots,

I also played with 3rd Party library for diplaying warning message.
